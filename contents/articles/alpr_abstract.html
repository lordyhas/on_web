        Today,many camera are deployed exclusively for surveillance purpose.
        This makes content tracking and analysis expensive, not to mention human errors
        and mistakes that can be caused by carelessness and fatigue. In this work we propose
        a machine learning method which allows computer systems to derive meaningful information 
        from digital images, of license plate. An automatic recognition of license 
        plate using optimizers which are on the stochastic gradient descent is carried out. 
        The main objective of this study is to examine the different optimizers and determine the
        best able to recognize license plates, in spite of possible geometric transformations,
        in order to reduce the constraints in the detection of license plates as to the position
        of the camera. Experiments on several license plates made it possible to validate the
        performance obtained with this approach.
